  <h1>Writing Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>The software development process is a process software engineers/designers go through to ensure the creation of quality software that provides the best user experience and results. The process starts with   gathering the requirements needed for the specific software. This can include certain features or functionality, styles, layouts, or any other specifications that a client might want to implement into the software. The software developer might ask themselves questions such as what the problem is they are solving with the software or who will be using the product and further ask questions to gather all the relevant information.     Moreover, the software can then be designed first using pseudocode as a clear and understandable draft of how the software will look and then implementing the plan into actual code on a computer. Lastly, the program must  then be tested to ensure that it meets all the specific requirements that were laid out before hands and the programmer must devise test cases to validate and verify the quality of the software they have developed and maintain it in case of any unexpected situations.
  Software design is important because it helps programmers and software developers thoroughly plan out all the steps they need to take before actually beginning the programming step of software development. It helps to avoid fewer mistakes or forgetting any key requirements for the software during its development. Errors are inevitable for programmers and to minimize the need to backtrack during the software development process because they might have forgotten to implement something or realize something has been mixed up, software developers plan out things such as the requirements, functionality, and design of the software beforehand which overall improves the quality of software and perhaps their reputation as a software developer.
  Personally, I feel as if Google Classroom is a well-designed software used primarily as an online classroom setting during the COVID-19 pandemic at my high school. The user interface is very neat and understandable, so much so that students from primary school all the way to high school were able to comfortably use it. All your classes were displayed on the homepage with a reminder on the side and under each class of assignments that were due during that week. Google Classroom also always sent notifications if there were any announcements or assignments posted in any of your classes. Furthermore, there was a to-do list that showed all your submitted,       pending, and missing assignments. The flawless design made it easy for students to have an easier time transitioning to the online learning environment and continue their learning even through the global pandemic.

<p>The requirements gathering stage of the software development process is the stage at which the different specifications and functionality that the software being developed must have. In this stage, the software developer usually asks their client questions relating to the software and what exactly they want it to do. Questions can be asked about the design or layout of the software, user interface, how it should work, what it should do, who will be using it, and any other expectations. This process allows the developer to gain some insight into what exactly their client expects of them and what the result should be. For example, if asked to develop an app that would be used by students to navigate a university, questions such as should the estimated distance and time be displayed or should all buildings such as residences and restaurants on campus be shown can be asked. Moreover, this stage is important to software developers because it can help reduce the number of mistakes made during the process. It can also help them efficiently solve the problem presented to them by the client and act as a checklist to ensure that their software meets all the requirements during the testing stage.

  <p>Empathy is of being aware, sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, thoughts, and experiences of another person without having them explicitly communicated to you. Empathy in organizations is seen when organizations take the extra steps to completely understand the people, they’re providing services to and the way they use and interact with their products, as opposed to simply seeing them as consumers or “sheep” that just buy products like emotionless robots. 
One of the elements of empathy is being able to understand a person or group’s subjective experience vicariously. When organizations display empathy and share the experiences of their audience it creates an understanding between the two while also maintaining a level of objectivity from the observer. This ties into another element that requires a level of objectivity and professionalism when it comes to sharing the emotions and experiences of others when being empathetic. Another element of empathy is nonverbal communication. When empathy is developed in organizations, they are more able to understand their customer’s feelings without being explicitly told or observed, which is important when conducting research on their products or services. Moreover, being culturally sensitive is another element of empathy that can help organizations expand their reach and understand the different ways that their customers might user their products and services, along with their experiences which may vary across cultures.
One of the business models is the Consumer model which looks at people as nothing more than consumers whose only purpose is to make purchases. This model is disrespectful and completely strips away human factors such as emotion, culture, and other factors that influence human behavior. The problem with this model is that it creates a barrier for empathy in an organization since there’s a sense of superiority in this model. This model lacks the element of emotion which it does not consider when explaining customer behaviors.
In the Sheep business model, customers are seen as gullible sheep that can easily be influenced by marketing and popular opinion to make purchases. This model focuses primarily on persuasion through marketing communication which businesses use to create and control consumer demand. The problem with his model is that it creates a disconnect between marketing and design within organizations thus destroying the inherent communication needed for empathy. This leads to customers buying a product only to be disappointed that their experience isn’t the same as the one they’ve been sold.
Furthermore, in the Homo Economicus business model, human behavior is seen as consciously calculated decisions to maximize utility and the feeling of getting a return on investment either with features or number of units. Although this model focuses more on the services and products businesses provide, it truly only focuses on what might prompt a user to buy a product, instead of the actual experience that the product provides. This model lacks an understanding of the user’s experiences which shows a lack of the cultural sensitivity element since experiences can vary across cultures.

  <p>Apple, as outlined in chapter 5 of “Subject to Change”, has undoubtedly made use of personas in the design of the Apple iPod. Firstly, the iPod was smaller than any other mp3 player on the market at the time, with still a relatively large amount of storage. Additionally, there was an aesthetic appeal to it, an outstanding user interface and the ability to provide access to thousands of songs. However, the iPod was very limited in functionality. Despite this, Apple developed a system for the iPod that contributed to its design which made the iPod a success despite it only being able to browse, rate, and play media. This system was the iTunes software, which allowed users to manage their media, and the iTunes store, which allowed users to purchase media to be able to use. This relieved the iPod of some of the expected functionality it might have had.

  <p>Prototyping is an important step in the software development process that involves creating early, and simplified versions of a software application to test and refine its user interface before the actual development of the software begins. This process is done because it helps to mitigate risks and errors, provide communication between developers and clients, and enhance the user experience ensuring the final product aligns with the user’s expectations. Firstly, one of the key benefits to prototyping is that it’s a great way of providing user feedback. Users can interact with the prototype before the development begins which can help clarify requirements, identify design flaws, and provide valuable feedback to software developers. Moreover, another key benefit is that it is an effective way of communicating between developers, users, designers, and clients. It can help remove any misunderstandings and clarify any expectations the client has for the software. Lastly, a key benefit of prototyping is that it mitigates risks. Prototyping can help identify technical and design challenges early in the development process which can lower the chance of costly rework in the future and allows developers and designers to explore various approaches to come up with the best solution. The first step to creating a paper prototype is to outline the objectives for your specific prototype and the different tasks you want to test or showcase. Next, you must sketch a rough design of the user interface on paper to show different screens or interactions a user might see in the software. The paper prototype must include interactive elements that can help users visualize what exactly they’re doing so that it simulates actual user experiences. Lastly, use the paper prototype to walk the users through specific tasks or scenarios while collecting feedback and making notes so that you may refine the prototype as necessary until your design aligns with the expectations and requirements.
