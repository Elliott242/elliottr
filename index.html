  <h1>Writing Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>The software development process is a process software engineers/designers go through to ensure the creation of quality software that provides the best user experience and results. The process starts with   gathering the requirements needed for the specific software. This can include certain features or functionality, styles, layouts, or any other specifications that a client might want to implement into the software. The software developer might ask themselves questions such as what the problem is they are solving with the software or who will be using the product and further ask questions to gather all the relevant information.     Moreover, the software can then be designed first using pseudocode as a clear and understandable draft of how the software will look and then implementing the plan into actual code on a computer. Lastly, the program must  then be tested to ensure that it meets all the specific requirements that were laid out before hands and the programmer must devise test cases to validate and verify the quality of the software they have developed and maintain it in case of any unexpected situations.
  Software design is important because it helps programmers and software developers thoroughly plan out all the steps they need to take before actually beginning the programming step of software development. It helps to avoid fewer mistakes or forgetting any key requirements for the software during its development. Errors are inevitable for programmers and to minimize the need to backtrack during the software development process because they might have forgotten to implement something or realize something has been mixed up, software developers plan out things such as the requirements, functionality, and design of the software beforehand which overall improves the quality of software and perhaps their reputation as a software developer.
  Personally, I feel as if Google Classroom is a well-designed software used primarily as an online classroom setting during the COVID-19 pandemic at my high school. The user interface is very neat and understandable, so much so that students from primary school all the way to high school were able to comfortably use it. All your classes were displayed on the homepage with a reminder on the side and under each class of assignments that were due during that week. Google Classroom also always sent notifications if there were any announcements or assignments posted in any of your classes. Furthermore, there was a to-do list that showed all your submitted,       pending, and missing assignments. The flawless design made it easy for students to have an easier time transitioning to the online learning environment and continue their learning even through the global pandemic.

  <p>The requirements gathering stage of the software development process is the stage at which the different specifications and functionality that the software being developed must have. In this stage, the software developer usually asks their client questions relating to the software and what exactly they want it to do. Questions can be asked about the design or layout of the software, user interface, how it should work, what it should do, who will be using it, and any other expectations. This process allows the developer to gain some insight into what exactly their client expects of them and what the result should be. For example, if asked to develop an app that would be used by students to navigate a university, questions such as should the estimated distance and time be displayed or should all buildings such as residences and restaurants on campus be shown can be asked. Moreover, this stage is important to software developers because it can help reduce the number of mistakes made during the process. It can also help them efficiently solve the problem presented to them by the client and act as a checklist to ensure that their software meets all the requirements during the testing stage.
Google Classroom User Stories
1.	As a student, I want to be able to see my current assignments on the main page so that I can see all that I have to complete.
2.	As a teacher, I want to receive reminders and notifications about when my classes are so that I can be reminded when I have a class to teach.
3.	As a student, I want to receive notifications or emails when assignments or announcements are posted in my classes so that I won’t miss when an announcement is made.
4.	As a teacher, I want to be able to see all my student’s grades for an assignment in alphabetical order to make it easier to submit their grades online.
5.	As a student, I want to be able to message my teachers directly and privately on the app, or add comments to specific assignments so that I can communicate with them when I have problems or issues on assignments or tests.
